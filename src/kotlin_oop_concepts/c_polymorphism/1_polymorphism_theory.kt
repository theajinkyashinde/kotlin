/* INFORMATION

Polymorphism:
-   Poly means many, whereas morph means forms. So polymorphism is nothing but many forms in linguistic term.
-   In Computer Science, it is defined as:
    Method name is same, but it will behave differently based on the object.
-    function overloading and inheritance.

This can be achieved in OOP using following polymorphism types.
1.  Static Polymorphism - Compile-Time - Function Overloading
    Please refer 2_function_overloading_and_polymorphism.kt for further information and implementation

2.  Dynamic Polymorphism - Run-Time - Inheritance
    Please refer 3_a_basic_inheritance.kt, 3_b_overriding, 3_c_inheritance_and_polymorphism
    for further information and implementation
